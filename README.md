# Event Loop Exercise

## Overview

This repository, developed as part of the Per Scholas Software Engineering Program, includes exercises to deepen understanding of the JavaScript event loop, recursion, and asynchronous programming. Each part of the exercise demonstrates key concepts of JavaScript execution that are essential for efficient coding practices.

## Exercises

### Part 1: Stack Overflow Prevention

Demonstrates how an infinite recursive function call leads to a stack overflow and how to catch this error in JavaScript.

### Part 2: Array Flattening Techniques

Implements three different methods to flatten nested arrays in JavaScript, illustrating iterative and recursive approaches.

### Part 3: Asynchronous Prime Calculation

Calculates prime numbers up to a given limit using a for loop that allows UI updates and prevents blocking through asynchronous execution.
